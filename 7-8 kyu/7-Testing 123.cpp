/* Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with 
implementing the line numbering.

Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.
The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. 
Notice the colon and space in between.

Examples: (Input --> Output)
["a", "b", "c"] --> ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]
